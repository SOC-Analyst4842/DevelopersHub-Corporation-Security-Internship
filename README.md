## Overview

This repository is structured to document the progression of security enhancement tasks over the course of three weeks. Each week focuses on different aspects:

- **Week 1:** Conducting a security assessment on the OWASP Juice Shop application.
- **Week 2:** Implementing security measures such as input validation, password hashing, token-based authentication, and securing HTTP headers.
- **Week 3:** Performing advanced penetration testing, setting up secure logging using the Winston library, and creating a comprehensive security best practices checklist.

All tasks are documented with step-by-step instructions, code snippets, screenshots, and video recordings for clarity and reproducibility.

## Week 1: Security Assessment

**Objective:**  
Evaluate the OWASP Juice Shop web application for vulnerabilities using both automated (OWASP ZAP) and manual testing techniques (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).

**Key Activities:**

- Environment setup and application deployment on Kali Linux.
- Execution of automated scans and manual tests.
- Documentation of findings with screenshots and detailed observations.

---

## Week 2: Implementing Security Measures

**Objective:**  
Enhance the application’s security by mitigating identified vulnerabilities. This week focused on:

- **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Using the Validator library to ensure proper data formats.
- **Password Hashing:** Securing user credentials with Bcrypt.
- **Token-Based Authentication:** Implementing Jsonwebtoken for secure session management.
- **Securing HTTP Headers:** Utilizing Helmet.js to protect against common web attacks.

Each task includes code snippets, testing steps, and verification screenshots.

## Week 3: Advanced Security and Final Reporting

**Objective:**  
Further strengthen security through advanced measures:

- **Advanced Penetration Testing:** Using Nmap for port scanning, service version detection, aggressive scanning, vulnerability scanning with NSE scripts, and external IP scanning.
- **Secure Logging Implementation:** Configuring the Winston library to log application events and errors to both the console and a dedicated log file (`security.log`).
- **Security Best Practices Checklist:** Creating a comprehensive checklist in MS Word outlining critical security measures.

Detailed results, documentation, and video recordings of each task are provided.
